### 3. VERIFIER ALIGNMENT

#### GSD gsd-verifier (524 lines)

```yaml
Core Philosophy:
  - Task completion ≠ Goal achievement
  - Goal-backward verification (not task-forward)
  - Do NOT trust SUMMARY.md claims
  - Verify what ACTUALLY exists in code

Three-Level Verification:
  Level 1: Exists (file present)
  Level 2: Substantive (not a stub)
  Level 3: Wired (connected/used)

Artifact Verification:
  - Use gsd-tools for automated checks
  - Map to must_haves from PLAN frontmatter
  - Status: VERIFIED | STUB | MISSING | ORPHANED

Key Link Verification:
  - Component → API (fetch + response handling)
  - API → Database (query + result returned)
  - Form → Handler (handler + API call)
  - State → Render (state displayed)
```

#### OpenCodeKit review (104 lines)

```yaml
Core Philosophy:
  - Read-only review agent
  - Quality guardian mindset
  - Severity-ranked findings (P0-P3)

Triage Criteria:
  - Affects correctness, performance, security
  - Introduced or worsened by change
  - Fixable without unrealistic rigor
  - Author would actually want to fix

Gaps vs GSD:
  - Reviews code changes, not goal achievement
  - No three-level artifact verification
  - No key link verification
  - No stub detection patterns
```

#### Recommended: New verify Agent OR Enhanced review

````markdown
## Option A: New verify Agent (recommended)

Create `.opencode/agent/verify.md` as goal-backward verifier:

```yaml
---
description: Goal-backward verification agent - checks if goals are achieved, not just tasks completed
mode: subagent
---
Core Responsibilities: 1. Load PRD success criteria
  2. Derive observable truths
  3. Verify artifacts exist and are substantive
  4. Verify key links are wired
  5. Detect stubs and anti-patterns
  6. Report gaps in structured format
```
````

## Option B: Enhanced review Agent

Add section to existing review.md:

- Goal-backward verification mode
- Three-level artifact checking
- Stub detection patterns
- Key link verification

````

### 4. DEBUGGER ALIGNMENT

#### GSD gsd-debugger (1,199 lines)
```yaml
Core Philosophy:
  - User = Reporter, Claude = Investigator
  - Meta-debugging: fighting your own mental model
  - Scientific method: falsifiable hypotheses
  - Foundation principles: observable facts only

Cognitive Biases to Avoid:
  - Confirmation bias
  - Anchoring
  - Availability bias
  - Sunk cost fallacy

Investigation Techniques:
  - Binary search / divide and conquer
  - Rubber duck debugging
  - Minimal reproduction
  - Working backwards
  - Differential debugging
  - Observability first
  - Comment out everything
  - Git bisect

Debug File Protocol:
  Location: .planning/debug/{slug}.md
  Sections: Symptoms, Eliminated, Evidence, Resolution
  Update rules: OVERWRITE vs APPEND
  Status transitions: gathering → investigating → fixing → verifying → resolved
````

#### OpenCodeKit Skills

```yaml
Existing:
  - systematic-debugging skill
  - root-cause-tracing skill

Gaps vs GSD:
  - No debug file protocol
  - No persistent debug state
  - No cognitive bias awareness
  - No investigation technique library
```

#### Recommended: Port to New Skill

```markdown
## Create `.opencode/skill/gsd-debugging/SKILL.md`

Port GSD debugger content as skill:

- Scientific method framework
- Hypothesis testing protocol
- Investigation techniques (8 methods)
- Debug file protocol
- Verification patterns
- Research vs reasoning decision tree
```

---

### 5. RESEARCH AGENTS ALIGNMENT

#### GSD Research Agents

```yaml
gsd-phase-researcher:
  - Domain research for specific phases
  - Stack investigation
  - Architecture patterns
  - Pitfall identification

gsd-research-synthesizer:
  - Aggregates parallel research findings
  - Resolves conflicts
  - Produces unified recommendations

gsd-project-researcher:
  - Project-level ecosystem research
  - Similar to phase-researcher but broader
```

#### OpenCodeKit Research Agents

```yaml
scout (91 lines):
  - External research specialist
  - Source quality hierarchy
  - Concise recommendations

explore (65 lines):
  - Read-only codebase cartographer
  - LSP-based symbol lookup
  - Usage pattern discovery
```

#### Gap: Research Synthesizer

```markdown
## Missing: gsd-research-synthesizer equivalent

When multiple scout/explore agents run in parallel,
there's no dedicated agent to:

- Aggregate findings
- Resolve conflicts
- Produce unified recommendations

Recommendation: Add synthesis responsibility to plan agent
or create dedicated research-lead agent.
```

---

### 6. SPECIALIZED GSD AGENTS (No OpenCodeKit Equivalent)

#### gsd-plan-checker (~400 lines)

```markdown
Validates plans against requirements before execution.

Dimensions Checked:

- requirement_coverage: All requirements have tasks
- task_completeness: All tasks have required elements
- dependency_correctness: Dependencies are valid
- key_links_planned: Critical connections planned
- scope_sanity: Plan is achievable
- must_haves_derivation: must_haves exist and are valid

Recommendation: Add as skill or plan agent mode
```

#### gsd-roadmapper (~300 lines)

```markdown
Creates roadmap.md with phase structure.

Outputs:

- project.md (vision)
- REQUIREMENTS.md (scoped v1/v2)
- roadmap.md (phases with goals)

## Summary

**GSD's Strength:** Deep, rigorous methodology with explicit protocols for every phase.

**OpenCodeKit's Strength:** Clean architecture, Beads integration, skills system.

**The Opportunity:** Port GSD's execution discipline (deviation rules, goal-backward verification, checkpoint protocol) into OpenCodeKit's cleaner architecture. Don't adopt GSD's ceremony — adapt its rigor.

**Key Principle:** Plans ARE prompts. Don't create documents that become prompts — create the prompt directly. This is GSD's core insight that OpenCodeKit should adopt.
