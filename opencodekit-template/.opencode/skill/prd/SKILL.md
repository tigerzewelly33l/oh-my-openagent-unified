# PRD Creation Skill

## When to Use

- After a design is validated and you need formal requirements and acceptance criteria
- Before breaking work into tasks or plans for features, migrations, or refactors

## When NOT to Use

- When you already have an approved PRD and only need task conversion
- For small, mechanical changes where a PRD would be overhead





## Beads-Native Output (Recommended)

When you are working on a Beads task (you have a bead id like `br-...`), the PRD should live with the task artifacts:

- Write PRD to: `.beads/artifacts/<bead-id>/prd.md`

This keeps requirements + execution tasks colocated with the bead.

If no bead id exists, create one first: `br create "Feature Name"`, then use the artifact path.

## Workflow

1. Confirm if the user has an existing bead id.
   - If yes: use `.beads/artifacts/<bead-id>/prd.md`
   - If no: create bead with `br create "Feature Name"`, then use artifact path
2. Read template from `.opencode/memory/_templates/prd.md`
3. Ask clarifying questions (5–7 max).
4. Explore codebase patterns and constraints.
5. Write a PRD following the template structure, including:
   - Bead Metadata (dependencies, parallel, conflicts)
   - Requirements with WHEN/THEN scenarios
   - Machine-convertible `## Tasks` section

## Clarifying Questions

### Problem & Motivation

- What problem does this solve? Who experiences it?
- What's the cost of NOT solving this? (user pain, revenue, tech debt)
- Why now? What triggered this work?

### Users & Stakeholders

- Who are the primary users? Secondary users?

### End State & Success

- What does "done" look like? How will users interact with it?

### Scope & Boundaries

- What's explicitly OUT of scope?
- What's deferred to future iterations?
- Are there adjacent features that must NOT be affected?

### Constraints & Requirements

- Performance requirements?
- Security requirements? (auth, data sensitivity, compliance)
- Compatibility requirements? (browsers, versions, APIs)
- Accessibility requirements? (WCAG level, screen readers)

### Risks & Dependencies

- What could go wrong? Technical risks?
- External service dependencies?
- What decisions are still open/contentious?

## Output Format

**Read the template:** `.opencode/memory/_templates/prd.md`

Follow the template structure which includes:

- Bead Metadata (dependencies, parallel execution, conflicts)
- Problem Statement with WHEN/THEN scenarios
- Scope (In/Out)
- Requirements (Functional + Non-Functional)
- Success Criteria with verification commands
- Technical Context and Affected Files
- Tasks section with Metadata (depends_on, parallel, files)

### Task Format (Critical)

Tasks must include **Metadata** for dependency tracking:

````markdown
### <Task Title> [category]

<One sentence describing the end state>

**Metadata:**

```yaml
depends_on: []
parallel: true
conflicts_with: []
files: []
```
````

**Verification:**

- [Command or check]

```

## Next Steps

After PRD is written, tell the user:

```

PRD written: .beads/artifacts/<bead-id>/prd.md

Next: Convert to executable tasks:
skill({ name: "prd-task" })

Or view the full lifecycle:
skill({ name: "development-lifecycle" })

```

## Key Principles

- Problem Before Solution
- Define End State, Not Process
- Technical Context Enables Autonomy
- Non-Goals Prevent Scope Creep
- Risks & Alternatives Show Rigor
- Include Metadata for parallel execution
```
