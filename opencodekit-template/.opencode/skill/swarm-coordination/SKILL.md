# Swarm Coordination - Kimi K2.5 PARL Multi-Agent Execution

> **Replaces** manual task-by-task execution of large plans — sequential bottleneck when tasks have no dependencies

## When to Use

- Implementing plans with 3+ independent tasks that can run in parallel
- You need structured coordination, monitoring, and delegation across many agents

## When NOT to Use

- Single-task or tightly sequential work without parallelizable groups
- Simple 1–2 file changes better handled by a single agent

## Overview

**Swarm = Leader + Workers + Reconciler + Progress Tracking + Todo Persistence**

- **Leader (build agent)**: Orchestrates the swarm - analyzes tasks, spawns workers, monitors progress, synthesizes results
- **Workers (general/explore/review/plan agents)**: Execute independent tasks - read delegation, make changes, report progress
- **Reconciler**: Watches for CI failures, detects broken builds, auto-spawns fix tasks - this is the self-healing mechanism
- **Progress Tracker (swarm-progress.jsonl)**: Real-time progress updates with TUI visualization
- **Todo Persistence (swarm-todos.json)**: Cross-session recovery for interrupted swarms

**Key Tools**:

| Tool    | Purpose                    | When to Use          |
| ------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `swarm` | Unified swarm coordination | All swarm operations |

**swarm operations:**

- `plan`: Task classification & dependency graph (before spawning workers)
- `delegate`: Create delegation packets (assigning work to workers)
- `monitor`: Progress tracking + TUI visualization (during swarm execution)
- `sync`: Sync Beads ↔ OpenCode todos (session start, cross-session)

**Key Distinction**:

- **Swarm**: Parallel execution of independent tasks with dynamic allocation
- **Beads**: Task tracking and dependency management across sessions
- **Task tool**: Spawning individual subagents for research/execution
- **swarm tool**: Unified operations for planning, monitoring, delegation, and sync

**When to Use Swarm Coordination**:

- "Does this plan have 3+ independent tasks?" → **YES** = Swarm
- "Can multiple tasks run in parallel without conflicts?" → **YES** = Swarm
- "Do I need to coordinate multiple agents?" → **YES** = Swarm
- "Is this a single task or sequential dependency chain?" → **NO** = Single agent

**Kimi K2.5 PARL Patterns**:

- **Task Classification**: Auto-detect parallelization potential
- **Anti-Serial-Collapse**: Prevent forced sequential execution
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Conservative start, scale based on bottlenecks
- **Progress Visualization**: Real-time TUI with beautiful markdown blocks
- **Dependency Graphs**: DAG-based task scheduling with critical path analysis

## When to Use Swarm vs Single Agent

| Scenario                      | Approach     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1-2 file changes              | Single agent |
| Sequential dependencies       | Single agent |
| 3+ independent parallel tasks | Swarm        |
| Cross-domain work (FE/BE/DB)  | Swarm        |
| Time-sensitive parallel work  | Swarm        |

## Quick Reference - Kimi K2.5 PARL Pattern

```
SWARM LAUNCH (PARL):
  0. SETUP: swarm({ operation: "sync", action: "push" })
     → Make Beads visible to subagents
  1. ANALYZE: swarm({ operation: "plan", action: "analyze", task: userRequest, files: detectedFiles })
     → Get classification, phases, dependency_graph
  2. CHECK: swarm({ operation: "plan", action: "check", ... })
     → Detect/prevent serial collapse
  3. DELEGATE: swarm({ operation: "delegate", ... })
     → Create packets for each worker
  4. SPAWN: Task({ subagent_type: "general" })
     → Launch workers using parallelizable_groups order
  5. MONITOR: swarm({ operation: "monitor", action: "render_block" })
     → Real-time TUI progress
  6. VERIFY: npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test
  7. CLOSE: swarm({ operation: "sync", action: "pull" }) && br close <bead>

WORKER EXECUTION:
  1. Read delegation packet
  2. Report START: swarm({ operation: "monitor", action: "progress_update", progress: 0, status: "working" })
  3. Execute with constraints
  4. Report PROGRESS (every 25%): swarm({ operation: "monitor", action: "progress_update", progress: 25/50/75 })
  5. Run acceptance checks
  6. Report DONE: swarm({ operation: "monitor", action: "progress_update", progress: 100, status: "completed" })

COORDINATION:
  - Progress: .beads/swarm-progress.jsonl (via swarm monitor)
  - Delegation: .beads/artifacts/<id>/delegation.md (via swarm delegate)
  - Analysis: swarm tool for classification + dependency graphs

RECOVERY:
  - Check: swarm({ operation: "monitor", action: "status" })
  - Use shared task lists: swarm({ operation: "sync", action: "create_shared" })
  - Continue with remaining workers

SHUTDOWN:
  - All workers done → swarm({ operation: "monitor", action: "clear" })
  - Run full test suite
  - swarm({ operation: "sync", action: "pull" })
  - Close parent bead
```

## Tools Reference

| Tool      | Purpose                    | Key Operations                        |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **swarm** | Unified swarm coordination | `plan`, `monitor`, `delegate`, `sync` |

**swarm operations:**

- `plan`: Task analysis + dependency DAG (actions: analyze, classify, check, allocate)
- `delegate`: Create delegation packets
- `monitor`: Progress tracking + visualization (actions: progress_update, render_block, status, clear)
- `sync`: Beads ↔ OpenCode todos (actions: push, pull, create_shared, get_shared, update_shared, list_shared)

## Rules

1. **Leader spawns, workers execute** - Clear role separation
2. **Delegation packets are contracts** - Workers follow them strictly
3. **Progress tracking for coordination** - All status via swarm monitor progress updates
4. **Non-overlapping assignments** - Ensure workers edit different files
5. **Acceptance checks required** - Workers verify before reporting done
6. **Persist periodically** - Enable cross-session recovery
7. **Use dependency graph** - Spawn workers in parallelizable_groups order
8. **Graceful shutdown** - Leader waits for all workers, syncs back to Beads
9. **Use tmux for visibility** - Enable visual monitoring when available
10. **Use reconciler at scale** - Required for 50+ agents, recommended for 10+
11. **Reconciler watches continuously** - Spawns fix tasks on detected failures

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                            | Why It Fails                                               | Instead                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spawning agents for tasks with shared file dependencies | Workers block or overwrite each other, causing merge churn | Partition work by non-overlapping files/modules first             |
| Not tracking agent completion status                    | Leader loses visibility; work appears done when it is not  | Require `monitor.progress_update` lifecycle (start/progress/done) |
| Dispatching without pre-computed dependency graph       | Tasks run out of order, causing rework and serial fallback | Run `swarm plan` first and dispatch by `parallelizable_groups`    |
| Using swarm for < 3 tasks (overhead not worth it)       | Coordination overhead exceeds execution savings            | Use a single agent or 2 direct `Task()` calls                     |
