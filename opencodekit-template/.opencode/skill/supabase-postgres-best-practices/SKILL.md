# Supabase Postgres Best Practices

## When to Use

- When optimizing or reviewing Postgres performance, schemas, or queries with Supabase guidance.

## When NOT to Use

- When the task is not related to Postgres performance or schema design.


## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Writing SQL queries or designing schemas
- Implementing indexes or query optimization
- Reviewing database performance issues
- Configuring connection pooling or scaling
- Optimizing for Postgres-specific features
- Working with Row-Level Security (RLS)

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and SQL examples:

```
rules/query-missing-indexes.md
rules/schema-partial-indexes.md
rules/_sections.md
```

Each rule file contains:

- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect SQL example with explanation
- Correct SQL example with explanation
- Optional EXPLAIN output or metrics
- Additional context and references
- Supabase-specific notes (when applicable)
